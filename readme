This is a program designed to solve the Starbucks Members problem in Design Problems 2 assignment in
CS220.  The code is comprised of 3 types of components.

Customer:
This file contains the customer's first and last name, the number of coupons they have, the number of coffees
towards the next free coffee coupon, their preferred coffee (stored as a String.  More interesting programs
can be written if Coffee was an object, but this would require more time and info), and a map that helps map
coupon names to the proper coupon.  This handles the adding and removing from a Customer's coupons, incrementing the amount of coffees they have for the next
coupon, and giving the customer a free coffee coupon when they reach 3 coffees, as well as setting a customer's
preferred coffee.

Coupon:
Coupons should be added as child classes extending Coupon.  Coupon is the parent class containing the title and
description, as well as parent methods to get the title and descriptions and alter a price to apply the
discount.  Children classes should override the applyCoupon method to properly apply their discount.  So far,
the only created Coupon is GetOneFree, which is the free coffee coupon required for other segments.

MembersList:
This is essentially a map of IDs (stored as Strings) to Customer objects.  It can retrieve customers from the
map, add customers, and remove customers.  IDs are assigned through a passed in variable in the addCustomer
method for convenience sake, however, the code could potentially be more useful if an ID generator was added
(similar to tinyURL).

The program you can use to test the code is TestDriverMain, which tests multiple features of the code.
